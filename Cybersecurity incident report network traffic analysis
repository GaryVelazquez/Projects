<h1> Cybersecurity incident report traffic analysis project </h1>

This project demonstrates how to analyze network traffic using tcpdump to identify issues with DNS resolution. 
The captured logs reveal a problem where DNS queries fail when attempting to resolve the domain yummyrecipesforme.com.

Problem Description

The client machine (192.51.100.15) repeatedly attempts to contact the DNS server (203.0.113.2) using the UDP protocol on port 53 (the standard port for DNS lookups).
Each request results in an ICMP "Port Unreachable" response, which indicates that the DNS server is not processing queries correctly.
