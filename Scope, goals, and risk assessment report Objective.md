Scope, goals, and risk assessment report
Objective

The Sercurity Audit project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating CIAtriad, SIEM and NIST CFS, OWASP princpiles knowledge. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world possible attack and weaknesses scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
Skills Learned

Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
Tools Used

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
Weakness and complaince testing scenarios.
